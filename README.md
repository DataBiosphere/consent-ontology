The primary Ontology Service API layer for the Data Use Oversight System [DUOS](https://github.com/broadinstitute/consent-ui)

## Data Use Oversight System

A semi-automated management service for compliant secondary use of human genomics data
There are restrictions on researching human genomics data. For example: “Data can only be used for breast cancer research with non-commercial purpose”.
The Data Use Oversight system ensures that researchers using genomics data honor these restrictions.

## Matching Algorithms

See [Algorithm](docs/Algorithms.md) and [Use Restriction Grammar](docs/UseRestrictionGrammar.md) for detailed information on how the system 
peforms data use matching between consented datasets and research purposes.
